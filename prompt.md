Give no explanation -- only a single file html (for an SPA -- with needed CSS/JS elements/code within the same source code).

I need a simple "event capacity counter" -- I want two buttons -- green and blue -- that represent cash vs. credit payments. I need a counter at the top that has total (and parenthesis with the two payment sub totals).

EACH time the button is pressed the type and time stamp are recorded.

The app needs a light/darkmode switch.

the data is stored ALSO in localstorage of the webbrowser.

two buttons are also at the button -- in red: reset counter (which has an "are you sure"/confirmation sub menu) and orange button for "download" -- which collects all the data into a json file.
